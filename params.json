{"body":"### Welcome.\r\n\r\nYouth Democracy is an open-source project that aims to build a robust and social tool for analyzing political data. There is large amount of politically relevant information on the internet. Our goal is to integrate, organize, compact and make available all this data to our users. We hope to combine information from social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and Google+), blogs, news agencies and the internet in general. So that users may have a deeper insight and a better outlook towards politics.\r\n\r\nOur project is active at [www.youthdemocracy.in](www.youthdemocracy.in)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could also join our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Youth-Democracy/171545239644634).\r\n\r\n### Get Involved\r\nOur overall project has been broken down into smaller sub-projects.
